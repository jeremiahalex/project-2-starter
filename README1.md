### Project 2
The IBM Watson / or some other Natural Language Processing  API service uses linguistic analysis to extract cognitive and social characteristics from input text such as email, text messages, tweets, forum posts, and more. By deriving cognitive and social preferences, the service helps users to understand, connect to, and communicate with other people on a more personalized level.

### How to Use
Users will have to register an account with us. After logging in. They can either use twitter to add text to find out more about the personality of the person they would like to research or use the text input form to enter their own text to analyze. The app will then return a short paragraph description of the findings.
