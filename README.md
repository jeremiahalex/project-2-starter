## Workflow

<!-- Did you write user stories, draw wireframes, use task tracking, produce ERDs? Did you use source control, with regular commits? Include links to them here. -->

### Wireframes

#### Landing page

The navigation bar slides up and hides itself when the page is scrolled up. It will slide down to reveal itself again when the page is scrolled down.

#### Consult Oracle page

Desktop and laptop users can hover their mouse cursors over the yarrow stalks and the gap will follow the cursor. The mouse cursor will change from the default arrow to a gloved hand pointer when it is over a gap. Upon reaching the desired spot, simply click on the gap to split the yarrow stalks. Clicking on the stalks will not trigger any split.

The slider bar below the yarrow stalks is primarily intended for smartphone and tablet users as they will not be able to hover over the stalk and precisely choose where the spilt the stalks. With the slider bar, smartphone and tablet users will be able to split the stalk with the same precision as desktop and laptop users. 

The yarrow stalks will resize to fit the width on smaller screens.

### User Stories

As a casual user of the Oracle of Changes, I
- want to try the traditional yarrow stalk oracle without having to follow complicated instructions and physical equipment.
- want to try the yarrow stalk oracle without having to create an account
- do not want to be bogged down by the repetitive, lengthly, and mistakes prone procedure of the yarrow stalk oracle.

As a serious/committed user of the Oracle of Changes, I
- want to regularly consult the traditional yarrow stalk oracle without the hefty time commitment (typically 20 to 30 minutes to obtain a hexagram).
- want the divination result to be automatically generated from the hexagram obtained from the oracle
- want to conveniently refer to reliable sources for divination texts.
- want reliable Chinese-English correspondence of divination texts at my fingertips.
- want a clean, streamlined experience stripped of all the kitsch and clich√©d design commonly associated with all things fortune-telling and Chinese.

- [Russell W. Cottrell, M.D.](http://www.russellcottrell.com/md/me.shtm) for his innovative [Virtual Yarrow Stalks](http://www.russellcottrell.com/VirtualYarrowStalks/). Instead of relying on the coin toss method or a random number generator, Dr. Cottrell's Virtual Yarrow Stalks featured a brilliant workaround by simply laying the yarrow stalks in a neat row across the screen with an inserted gap to simulate the split. This, I believe, is the best possible virtual counterpart to the physical spliting of yarrow stalks by hand. Dr. Cottrell's Virtual Yarrow Stalks subtantially replicates the traditional yarrow stalk method by intelligently adapting to the constraints of the new medium. Additionally, unlike the coin toss method, this allows uneven probabilities of obtaining lines 6, 7, 8, and 9 to be retained.
