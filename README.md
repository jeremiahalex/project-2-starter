<!-- Did you write user stories, draw wireframes, use task tracking, produce ERDs? Did you use source control, with regular commits? Include links to them here. -->

### Wireframes

#### Landing page

The navigation bar slides up and hides itself when the page is scrolled up. It will slide down to reveal itself again when the page is scrolled down.

#### Consult Oracle page

Desktop and laptop users can hover their mouse cursors over the yarrow stalks and the gap will follow the cursor. The mouse cursor will change from the default arrow to a gloved hand pointer when it is over a gap. Upon reaching the desired spot, simply click on the gap to split the yarrow stalks. Clicking on the stalks will not trigger any split.

The slider bar below the yarrow stalks is primarily intended for smartphone and tablet users as they will not be able to hover over the stalk and precisely choose where the spilt the stalks. With the slider bar, smartphone and tablet users will be able to split the stalk with the same precision as desktop and laptop users. 

The yarrow stalks will resize to fit the width on smaller screens.
