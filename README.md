### Project 2
The IBM Watson / or some other Natural Language Processing  API service uses linguistic analysis to extract cognitive and social characteristics from input text such as email, text messages, tweets, forum posts, and more. By deriving cognitive and social preferences, the service helps users to understand, connect to, and communicate with other people on a more personalized level.

### How to Use
Users will have to register an account with us. After logging in. They can use the text input to find out more about the personality profile of the person they would like to research or enter their own text to analyze. The minimum amount of text required is 100. But the more text add the more accurate the profile will be. The app will then return a percentile for each of the Big 5 Personality trait.
