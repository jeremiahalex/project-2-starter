This is a stock tracker app that can double as a real time stock tracker cum stock trading simulator to help users better keep in touch with the market and better manage their trading portfolios.

## Live version

### How to Use

Create an account by going to the register page, then log in at the log in page.

Subsequently, click on the 'Stock Positions' tab to take you to the page. Key in the stock name, ticker symbol, buy date, quantity bought and price bought. The app will then track the current price of the stock as well as how much you gained and lost from it, and provide you with a summary of your stock portfolio.

alphaVantageAPI.getIntradayData(entry.ticker, '1min')

```

## User Stories

This app seeks to help investors track their investments in real time, with the help of the API Alpha Vantage, which gives real time updates on share prices. (WIP not implemented yet) Users will have to create an account, and upon creation of their accounts, they can begin to input the shares that they have bought. The positions that they have taken will be stored, and can be condensed into a summary detailing their total profits and losses. The app can also double as a trading simulator for shares until the user feels confident enough to trade with real money.
