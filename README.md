# PROJECT 2

## ABOUT

Project 2 allows potential tutors to "advertise" themselves on the platform to students. Upon registering, a tutor would then have to wait for a request from potential students.

Students upon registering would be able to access the site and filter through potential teachers. Once they have found suitable teacher/s, they would then be able to send a request to them requesting for a session. The tutors would then get back to the students if interested.

### Using Two Passport Strategies

As the app allows both students and teachers to log on, passport would need to authenticate
