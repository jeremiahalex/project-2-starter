## Workflow

### User stories
As a user, I want to add tours that are related to my favourite films/tvshows into my cart so that I can book the tours for my future plans. I should not be able to add shows and tours.

As an administrator, I want to add shows and the available tours for each show so that I can make sure they are appropriate.

## Time Management
* **Day 1, Monday**: Drew up wireframes, ERD, routes and Pseudocode. Added login, register and started making forms for creating tours and shows

* **Day 2, Tuesday**: Added tvshow, tour routes for admin to add shows and tours to populate the database thereby finishing CRUD

* **Day 3, Wednesday**: Added user routes for cart and show routes for general users to book tours

* **Day 4, Thursday**: Added reviews and google maps API

* **Day 5, Friday**: Spent a considerable amount of time on the delete tour in cart function and learning how to use materialize CSS

* **Day 6/7, Saturday/Sunday**: More CSS

## Potential Improvements
* Add an admin function so only admins can add shows/tours
* Add blackout dates for tours/specific tour dates with radio buttons for users to choose from
* Fix error when users who are not logged in try to make reviews
* Add proper payment function
