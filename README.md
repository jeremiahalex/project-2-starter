# Project 2: Fridge Magnets

There has always been a problem in my family with different members of the family completed the same task without the knowledge of another family member. Through this project, I hope to develop a simple web application that family members will be informed once a task is completed.

## Live Version

Try it here:
https://fridgie-magnets.herokuapp.com/

## Workflow
* User first register for an account
* User can then create a new fridge which represents a group or a family
* In the fridge, members can add new task that needs to be completed to the fridge.
* User may either take up the task themselves, or wait until other members of the fridge takes up the task.
* Once the task is completed, another notification will be sent to all members of the fridge.
* Task will not be deleted until one of the members delete the task.
