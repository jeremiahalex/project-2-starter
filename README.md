# My Portfolio Manager

My Portfolio Manager is a simple investment tool to help an investor keep track of investments within a portfolio. It also provides an asset allocation view to help strategic allocation. It comprises the following features : user authentication, portfolio transactions, portfolio overview and basic charting.

## Built With

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)
* [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js)


## Workflow
The user is required to register before gaining access to the transaction and portfolio pages. Individual holdings in any asset class (equities, bonds, alternatives and cash) can be recorded at the transaction date and price bought (other than cash). Updates to the price can be made to each holding and once a position is sold, it will be converted to cash at the date sold.

There are several limitations to this tool currently. Transaction entries and updates are manual.
