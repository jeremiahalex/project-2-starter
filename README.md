#### Coding Theory

Due to time constraints, the project was greatly simplified. The main aim was to
create a functional CRUD for the users. If time allowed, we would utilise Google
Books API to search for book titles and allow for readers to record the books
that they've read.

#### Future Possible Updates

* Add reviews
* Add ratings
